# logic-authz-dsl-playground

This is a toy project that I worked on for a [blog
post](https://charlieegan3.com/posts/2021-05-08-authorization-dsls-in-go/).
Read the post to find out what this is all about.

Most 'interesting' code is in
[handlers](https://github.com/charlieegan3/logic-authz-dsl-playground/tree/main/internal/handlers).

All the functionality of the handlers is tested, run tests with:

```
go test ./...
```
